								<p>I've been struggling recently with the feeling that I haven't been as productive as I wanted to be, 
                                    and that I have wasted a lot of my time at RC. The past couple weeks have had a fair few personal 
                                    reaosns that made it hard to work. I think also having just come off of undergrad, 
                                    which burned me out pretty heavily, has made it a little more difficult for me to find interest in 
                                    technical subjects I'd normally be actively engaged in. Even so, I want to 
                                    focus on all of the real progress I have made in spite of that! 
                                    My batch technically ends this week, but I only switched to a half batch because 
                                    I have a potential job offer that conflicts with the last one or two weeks of the full batch.
                                     So in practice, I'll be here for most of the next 6 weeks. My fears of having wasted most of my time 
                                     are also alleviated by the fact that there's no real end date to RC. Even if these past couple of 
                                     weeks have been unideal, I just have to remember there doesn't need to be a rush to take advantage of 
                                     RC because the community is always going to be here. </p>
                                 

                                    <p>Anyway, some of my highlights from the first half of the batch:</p>
                                    <p>- Wrapped my head around gradient descent and random forest methods for machine learning, implemented simple projects in python</p>
                                    <p>- Learned LaTeX and wrote up an explainer on Gradient Descent in decent detail</p>
                                    <p>- Improved my familiarity with pandas and seaborns</p>
                                    <p>- Started keeping ALL my code on github instead of on my local computer</p>
                                    <p>- Got a good idea of future projects I want to work on--statistics python package in particular</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Moving forward, I think I'm going to slow down on my plans to 
                                        implement random forest on land use change patterns and just try 
                                        to do small projects as I get comfortable with ML. A large, daunting
                                         project with little direction isn't the best way for me to learn, at least. 
                                         So that'll go on the backburner, for now.</p>
